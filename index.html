			<h1>A Visual History of US-North Korea relations</h1>
			<p class="textpara">
			Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program have occurred for nearly 30 years. The debate over the efficacy of dialogue and engagement with North Korea has been raging even longer. Here we analyze the history of talks between the U.S. and North Korea to see if there are trends that could help shed light on the present nuclear conundrum.
			<br><br>
				Numerous studies have assessed various diplomatic efforts, including the 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework and the Six Party Talks, to explain the international community's failure to stop the DPRK's nuclear program and the complexities of negotiating with North Korea. However, there are few open source studies that have explored the entire record of nuclear diplomacy between North Korea and the United States and have tested the relationship between negotiations and other material variables to explain historical outcomes.

			<h2>First North Korean Nuclear Crisis & 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework</h2>

				The beginning of North Korea's ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons program can be traced as far back as the 1960's. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 had significant consequences for North Korea. The loss of support from its largest Cold War benefactor caused the regime to push for greater military self-reliance including through development of strategic nuclear weapons. Although North Korea only succeeded in testing a couple short-to-medium range ballistic missiles during this time the groundwork was laid for the first nuclear crisis. Given its limited nuclear capabilities at this time, North Korea continued to rely on conventional forces for deterrence purposes and to maintain leverage against South Korea and the U.S.  There appears to be little to no relationship between negotiations and provocations at this time.

				The discovery of a plutonium processing facility at Yongbyon in North Korea, fears about production of fissile material for nuclear weapons, and North Korea's rejection of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards agreement prompted the start of the 1st nuclear crisis. North Korean motives for developing a nuclear program were likely affected by the normalization of diplomatic relations between South Korea and the Soviet Union in 1990 and South Korea and China in 1992. The U.S. approach to the First Gulf War and Saddam Hussein was also probably a factor in their calculations. 
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				While tensions were high over the nuclear program developments, North Korea also tested several short-to-medium range missiles during this period of time. However, it was ultimately the return to negotiations in June 1994 (after a visit by former President Jimmy Carter to North Korea) that ultimately brought the immediate crisis to an end. In the 1994 Agreed Framework that followed, North Korea agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear reactors and allow IAEA inspectors to monitor the implementation process. In exchange, the U.S. agreed to provide two light-water reactor power plants and to provide security assurances while working towards normalization of bilateral relations.   

			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				While engagement in U.S.-DPRK bilateral nuclear negotiations did not prevent North Korea from carrying out overt military provocations, there were relatively less provocations than in subsequent periods.
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				In the nearly 30-year history of diplomatic negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea, the greatest number talks between the two countries occurred during this time. Both Washington and Pyongyang attempted to implement the provisions of the 1994 Agreed Framework through bilateral negotiations and working-level talks in the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO).
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				This period of engagement was occasionally punctuated by various North Korean provocations including North Korean ground troop infiltrations into South Korea in 1996 and the launch of a Taepo-dong missile in August 1998. However, on the whole the number of negotiations outweighed the number of provocations.
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				Suspicions about North Korea’s clandestine pursuit of an enriched uranium nuclear weapons program (in addition to the existing plutonium program) eventually surfaced at the end of the Clinton administration’s second term but were not verified until October 2002. Despite some progress, deep mutual distrust (and complicated domestic political dynamics) prevented both sides from implementing the Agreed Framework in an adequate and timely manner. 
			</p>
			<h2>Second North Korean Nuclear Crisis & Six Party Talks</h2>
			<p class="textpara">
				In October 2002, during a visit to Pyongyang by Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs James Kelly, the North Koreans admitted to having a parallel enriched uranium program. In the United States, this confirmed the worst fears about North Korea. While there were other obstacles that made implementation of the Agreed Framework difficult, the North Korean admission was the beginning of the end for that agreement.
